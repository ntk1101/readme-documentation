# Mundoprints Visiting Card

> *Project documentation with Markdown*

Mundoprints is a website specializes in visiting card printing, where we connect customers to local vendors (printers) and allow for a quick and easy visiting card printing.




## Build instruction

- We start off by signing up for a Wordpress Woocommerce Creator subscription. This will allow us to host and edit the website using elementor editor
- We decided to reuse the mundoprints.in interface. We used the Wordpress All-in-one migration to copy the mundoprints.in site to the enw wp site visiting.cards
- After the migration, we removed all the non-visiting card products and made Visiting Cards page the homepage
- use the following menu names and links for hompage: [Home](https://mundocards.wpcomstaging.com/), [About](https://mundocards.wpcomstaging.com/about-us/), Contact, [Privacy Policy](https://mundocards.wpcomstaging.com/notice-of-privacy/), [Vendor Login](https://mundocards.wpcomstaging.com/my-account/), [Cart](https://mundocards.wpcomstaging.com/cart/)
- Then Install Dokan Razorpay for payment transaction
- Integrated Zoho campaign plugins

## Issues
- We tried to implement Zakeke as a product customizer, but found out it does not support vendors, so we looking for alternative options
- Wordpress starter plan does not offer the best security features, needed to upgrade to a Creator plan for additonal plugins as well
- Tried to use WC Vendors, but it required pro subscription, so we used Dokan instead.
